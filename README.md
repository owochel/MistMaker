# MistMaker

**MistMaker** is an Arduino library for controlling piezoelectric mist maker modules using PWM, current sensing, and optional button toggling. It was developed for the custom PCB released during the **Open Hardware Summit 2025** workshop session.

This project is [Open Source Hardware Certified](https://certification.oshwa.org/us002742.html) under OSHWA ID **US002742**, enabling educators, artists, and developers to explore the creative potential of mist as a material and medium.

### 💻 Option 2: Clone or Copy into Libraries Folder (Advanced)

Clone this subfolder manually and place it inside your Arduino libraries directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owochel/Programmable-Mist-Maker.git
cp -r Programmable-Mist-Maker/MistMaker-Arduino-Library ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/MistMaker
```

Note: Your library location may be different. [Look at Arduino Support Article here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4415103213714-Find-sketches-libraries-board-cores-and-other-files-on-your-computer) to see how you can locate your Libary folder.
