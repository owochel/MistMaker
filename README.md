# MistMaker

**MistMaker** is an Arduino library for controlling piezoelectric mist maker modules using PWM, current sensing, and optional button toggling. It was developed for the custom PCB released during the **Open Hardware Summit 2025** workshop session.

This project is [Open Source Hardware Certified](https://certification.oshwa.org/us002742.html) under OSHWA ID **US002742**, enabling educators, artists, and developers to explore the creative potential of mist as a material and medium.

## 🌱 Features

- 108.7kHz PWM control for mist actuation
- Current sensing via analog input
- Toggle control using a button
- LED status indicator
- Designed for ESP32-based boards (tested on Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C6)
- Modular and reusable class-based structure

---

## 🧰 Hardware Requirements

- [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C6](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C6-Pre-Soldered-p-6328.html) (or compatible ESP32 board)
- Certified Mist Maker PCB from OHS 2025
- Piezo mist module
- Optional: Button (for manual toggle) and LED (for status)

## Board Compatibility

This library is designed for **ESP32-based boards** and relies on ESP32's LEDC PWM API for high-frequency mist control. It has been tested with:

- Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C6
- ESP32 DevKit V1
- ESP32-S3

❗ This library does **not support AVR-based boards** like Arduino Uno or Mega out of the box.

If you are using a different board and wish to adapt the library, you may need to:

- In the libary code, replace `ledcWrite()` and `ledcAttach()` with generic `analogWrite()` or board-specific PWM functions
- Adjust analog read scaling (12-bit vs 10-bit ADC)

## 📦 Installation

### 🔗 Option 1: Install via Arduino IDE using GitHub URL

1. In Arduino IDE, go to:  
   `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...`

2. Paste this URL into your browser and download the ZIP file:  
   [Download Library ZIP](https://github.com/owochel/MistMaker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

3. Select the downloaded ZIP file in Arduino IDE.

4. You're done! Now you can access example code via:  
   `File > Examples > MistMaker > SimpleControl`
   or
   `File > Examples > MistMaker > Blink`
---

### 💻 Option 2: Clone or Copy into Libraries Folder (Advanced)

Clone this subfolder manually and place it inside your Arduino libraries directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owochel/MistMaker.git
cp -r MistMaker ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/
```

Note: Your library location may be different. [Look at Arduino Support Article here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4415103213714-Find-sketches-libraries-board-cores-and-other-files-on-your-computer) to see how you can locate your Libary folder.
